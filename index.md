Responsibility \- Lead AI Architect | Role \- Senior AI / ML Engineer

**Project Title:** Accelerating Requirement Freeze with Generative AI  
**Description:** Developed a RAG-based solution that reduced the 'Requirement Freeze Phase' duration by leveraging prior knowledge, resulting in a significant reduction in cycle time.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Designed and implemented a comprehensive workflow for extracting requirements and images from OEM documents, automating the process of converting tables, block diagrams, and flowcharts into structured text.  
* Developed RAG workflow to classify requirements for acceptance, leveraging parent-child chunking and contextual retrieval to preserve relevance.  
* Integrated a re-ranker mechanism to streamline the context window, enhancing accuracy and optimizing computational costs.  
* Applied a reflection pattern for self-evaluation and query rewriting for better context retrieval to improve the system accuracy.  
* Developed an agentic RAG system capable of addressing system engineerâ€™s questions and clarifications within requirements. The solution dynamically retrieves additional context from different engineering systems using tool calls and intelligently prompts LLMs to execute actions in real time.

**Achievements:** Reduced the cycle time by 70% (from 6 month to 2 months)   
**Technology Stack:** Python, LangChain, LangGraph,Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude Haiku,Cohere Embed,Cross-Encoder, MongoDB (Vector DB), Ragas, Unstructured.io, FastAPI, AWS (Bedrock, StepFunction, Fargate), Docker.

**Project Title:** Personalized Virtual Assistant for effective search  
**Description:** Develop personalized conversational AI agents answering the users query by retrieving results from different engineering tools and user defined docs,ensuring contextually relevant.  
**Key Responsibilities:**

* Designed and built a virtual assistant capable of interacting with diverse data sources, including engineering tools, databases, and user-defined documents, to deliver comprehensive and accurate query resolutions.  
* Created intuitive and personalized conversational flows that leveraged user context and prior interactions to provide tailored and meaningful responses.  
* Implemented long-term memory management to retain conversation history effectively, optimize context windows, and enhance personalization in user interactions.  
* Integrated a Human-in-the-Loop to handle ambiguous queries, enabling the assistant to provide precise and validated answers.  
* Designed role-based access control mechanisms to restrict sensitive operations to authorized users.

**Achievements:** Minimize the time spend on non-value added search , improving productivity by 10%
